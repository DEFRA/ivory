      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-2">How your data will be used</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para1-2">
          Your data will be used by official authorities (Defra, APHA) to enforce the Ivory Act 2018.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para2-2">
          In respect of section 2 (items of outstandingly high artistic, cultural and historical value), we may need to contact the person who submitted the application if we need them to confirm any information provided in it.
          We will also need to notify them of the outcome of the application.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para3-2">
          In respect of section 10 (all other ivory items that are exempt under the Ivory Act 2018), we will need to send a confirmation of the registration to the person who submitted it.
          We may also need to contact the owner if we suspect that the item intended for sale or hire does not comply with the Ivory Act.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para4-2">
          We may also need to check that anyone attempting to sell or hire out an item containing elephant ivory is complying with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
        </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-3">Legal basis for processing your data</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para1-3">
          The processing of your personal data, which we carry out in connection with REACH, is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in Defra and APHA.
          We are allowed to process your data because we have official authority as the UK government departments regulating the implementation of the Ivory Act 2018 and CITES legislation.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para2-3">
          As part of the compliance process for the Ivory Act 2018, APHA may need to share personal data with other legal entities in relation to the enforcement of the Act.
        </p>
