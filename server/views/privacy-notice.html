      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-2">What personal data is collected, and how it is used</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para4-1">
          Defra and APHA will use personal data that you or someone authorised to act on your behalf provide. The personal data that we process are your name, postal and email address(es) and details of your ivory item to:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li id="listItemA1-1">assess your registration or application</li>
          <li id="listItemA2-1">issue an exemption certificate where applicable</li>
          <li id="listItemA3-1">comply with and enforce the Ivory Act</li>
          <li id="listItemA4-1">collate information for reporting</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="govuk-body" id="para5-1">
          If you complete a registration or application on behalf of a business, we will also collect and process the business name and address.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-3">How your data has been obtained</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para6-1">
          We have obtained your data from your application to deal in an exempted item of ivory from you directly or from someone authorised to act on your behalf.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-4">Why Defra and APHA are using your data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para7-1">
          When you make a registration or apply for an exemption certificate under the Ivory Act, we will use your data to check that you comply with and to enforce the Act. This means that we will keep official records of your compliance history as evidence. For purposes of enforcing the Act, we may share your data with other parties including the police, customer officers and prosecuting services.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para8-1">
           We will share your data when making an application for an exemption certificate so that an expert can determine whether they are able to assess your ivory item. A conflict of interest would stop them from assessing your ivory item. 
        </p>


        <p class="govuk-body" id="para9-1">
          Suppose an expert is able to assess your ivory item (meaning that there is no conflict of interest on their part). In that case, they will also assess whether, in their view, the item meets the criteria of being a pre-1918 item of outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para10-1">
          We may also share details of your ivory item with a prospective buyer or hirer when they contact APHA with a submission reference or exemption certificate reference number. Sharing information helps buyers feel assured the item they intend to buy or hire out is either registered or certified.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para11-1">
          With your consent, we will share with prescribed institutions:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li id="listItemB1-1">details of your ivory item (but not your name, contact details, or any other information identifying you) from your application for an exemption certificate</li>
          <li id="listItemB2-1">the Secretary of State’s decision on whether to award that an item an exemption certificate</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para12-1">
          This is to help further their expertise.There is no obligation for you to give your consent for this purpose, and it is entirely voluntary on your part.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para13-1">
          When you register or make an application for an exemption certificate to deal in an ivory item legally, we will use your data to send confirmation:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li id="listItemC1-1">of the registration for an item under the standard exemptions, or</li>
          <li id="listItemC2-1">that an application for a pre-1918 outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value item has been received</li>
          <li id="listItemC3-1">of the outcome of an application for an exemption certificate to the applicant</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para14-1">
          We may also:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li id="listItemD1-1">Contact you or someone acting on your behalf to request further information on the application</li>
          <li id="listItemD2-1">Contact you to tell you an application has been made on your behalf</li>
          <li id="listItemD3-1">Contact you if we suspect that any intent to deal in an ivory item does not comply with the Ivory Act 2018</li>
          <li id="listItemD4-1">check that you or someone acting on your behalf when dealing in an ivory item complies with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</li>
        </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-5">The legal basis for processing your data</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para15-1">
          Where APHA uses your data to help further an assessor’s expertise, the legal basis for this data-use is described in Article 6 (1) (a) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Article 6 (1) (a) relates to processing your data where you have freely and voluntarily given consent for your data to be used for that purpose. 
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para16-1">
          Where APHA uses your data to check that the dealing of an ivory item complies with the Ivory Act 2018, the legal basis for this data use is described in Article 6 (1) (e) of the UK GDPR. Article 6 (1) (e) relates to the processing of your data necessary for the exercise of official authority vested in the controller (Defra and APHA).
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para17-1">
          Defra and APHA are official authorities and make up a UK government department that has official responsibility for regulating the implementation and application of the Ivory Act 2018.
        </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-6">Consent to process your data to help further the expertise of the prescribed institution</h2>
        
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para18-1">
          You can withdraw your consent at any time <u>before</u> your data is shared with an expert assessor to help them to further their expertise.
        </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-7">A law-based requirement to provide personal data</h2>
        
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para19-1">
          You are required by law to provide your data to APHA so they can ensure that any dealing of your ivory item is compliant with the Ivory Act 2018. When the ban on dealing in ivory items commences in Spring 2022, there will be a statutory requirement under section 10 (1) and section 3 (1) of the Ivory Act 2018 for you to provide your personal data.
        </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-8">What happens if you do not provide the necessary data?</h2>
        
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para20-1">
          Without necessary data, we will not be able to process your registration or an application for an exemption certificate. Once the ivory ban comes into force in Spring 2022, you will not be able to deal in the ivory to which your application refers.
        </p>

     
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-9">Who Defra and APHA share your data with</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para21-1">
          We will share your data with the assessor who assesses the application to give their expert opinion on whether the item meets the exemption criteria. In this case, data sharing applies only to applications relating to pre-1918 items that are of outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para22-1">
          Your personal data is shared with expert assessors so they can feel assured that there is no conflict of interest. For example, if a potential assessor were related to an applicant, which would lead to a conflict of interest, that assessor would not assess that applicant’s ivory item. Instead, we will share your application and personal details with an assessor that does not have conflicting interests.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para23-1">
          We will not share your data with any other third parties, except where we are required to do so by law or court order, to detect or prevent crime, or to apprehend or prosecute offenders. 
        </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-10">Storing data outside the UK</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para24-1">
          Personal data may be stored or hosted in Ireland. 
        </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="h2-11">How long Defra and APHA hold personal data</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body" id="para25-1">
          Under the Ivory Act 2018, there is a statutory requirement for us to hold data on ivory items where an applicant has made a registration or applied for an exemption certificate. This registration or application would have been under the provisions governing exemptions in the Act.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body" id="para26-1">
          Personal data will be held for seven years from the date we receive your application. It will be reviewed to determine whether a further retention period is required to ensure compliance with and appropriate enforcement of the Ivory Act. Data will be manually deleted once it has been determined it is appropriate to do so.
        </p>
